# Super Ionic-app-platanus-2017

## Usage

The Platanus Ionic workflow tries to adhere as much as possible to the Cordova & Ionic way of doing things, so to do common tasks such as to serve, emulate or build your app, or adding platforms and plugins, use the Ionic and Cordova CLI commands you would regularly use. Some tasks are:

- `ionic serve` to serve the app to your browser
- `ionic emulate ios` to launch your app in the iOS emulator
- `ionic build android` to build an APK
- `ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-device` to add the Device Cordova plugin to the app and persist it on the config.xml
- `ionic state save` to confirm changes to Cordova config files
